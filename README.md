# CS-250 Sprint Review and Retrospective

- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I first have to gather the requirements for the project by interviewing the client. After I have gathered what the client requirements are, I prioritize them based on level of importance. 
  - One way to prioritize them is to create user stories, which are brief descriptions of a feature or functionality. User stories help clarify what the user wants, why they want it, and how it will benefit them. User stories are used for developing a program and as a reference for testing the program's usability. 

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - My approach to developing programs depends on the certainty of requirements from the client. If the client knows exactly what they want, a waterfall approach would be the route I would take. Since most of the time client's don't know exactly what they want, an agile approach is best suited. 
  - Agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future development work is Scrum and Extreme programming. I like Scrum because of its short sprints to deliver working software, the daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and obstacles, and its retrospective to reflect on each sprint and identify areas for improvement. I like Extreme Programming because of its emphasis on continuous feedback and improvement. It involves practices that are designed to improve the quality and productivity of the software development process. One practice is paired programming, which involves two developers working together on one computer. Another practice is test-driven programming which writes tests before the code is written for the product. 

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  - Being a good team member in software development means having a few important qualities such as effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability. Effective communication involves listening to others, giving clear and concise feedback, and asking questions to get a better understanding. Collaboration involves working with others and helping others when needed. Adaptibility involves being open to change, learning new skills, and being flexible when challenges or setbacks present themsevles. It's also important to be willing to learn from mistakes and to keep a positive attitude.
